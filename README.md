# Mezz CMS language files
This project contains the language files for https://mezz.gq.

With this project you can help update the translation for each language used.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, you can easily create a github.com account and use their online editor to change the files. It's also perfectly fine to fork the project and use git commands to update it if you're comfortable with that.

## Rules
To prevent a lot of back and forth on specific translations, please think twice before you want to fix an already translated part. This means for example American-English and Brazilian-Portugese. It's also partly because technically the language is tied to the domain extension of the hotel.

## Technicalities
The translation files are JSON files, although you can easily open these with your favourite editor.

- Please keep in mind that we use UTF-8 for the encoding,
so if you're not sure if your editor handles this, use "Save As" functionality and pick the UTF-8 encoding option.
- Some strings contain either HTML (recognizable by <> tags). Keep these parts in tact, they are used within the code. You might want to reorganize them based on proper grammar though.
- The backslash (\) sign next to the quotation marks (" ") is made for the HTML code to work properly, be careful when editing it.
